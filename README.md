# Text-Generation-Using-LSTM-Neural-Network
This repository contains a Python project for generating text using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The model is trained on a text corpus, learning to predict and generate sequences of characters based on input sequences. This project demonstrates skills in neural network design, text preprocessing, and sequence modeling.
